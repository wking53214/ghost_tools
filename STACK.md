# Stack role: ghost_tools

**ASSURANCE (not the live decision path).**

The scanner (Ghost Buster). Finds what is present and wrong: dead code, documentation drift, duplication, vacuous tests, secrets. Reports, never writes. Its findings keep their identity across the loop, and it says what it could not look at.

## The circuit

Seven repositories, one loop. Warden is the only one that writes, and nothing is
written without a named human.

| # | Part | Repository | Role |
|---|------|------------|------|
| 1 | Answer key | [ASSAY](https://github.com/wking53214/ASSAY) | Known failure modes with independently known answers; the scanner is graded against it before anything is written. |
| 2 | Scanner | [ghost_tools](https://github.com/wking53214/ghost_tools) (Ghost Buster) | Finds defects; findings keep their identity across the loop; says what it could not look at. |
| 3 | Attacker | [SWIZZLE](https://github.com/wking53214/SWIZZLE) | Proves its own planted defects, scores the scanner against the answer key, attacks the governor's rules. |
| 4 | Governor | [Warden](https://github.com/wking53214/Warden) | Runs the loop; the only part allowed to write; human grant, green suite before and after, durable record. |
| 5 | Drafter | [Drafter](https://github.com/wking53214/Drafter) | Proposes one fix at a time, as data. |
| 6 | Judge | [Judge](https://github.com/wking53214/Judge) | Reads the evidence of the whole run and says ACCEPT, REJECT or INSUFFICIENT. |
| 7 | Finisher | [Burnish](https://github.com/wking53214/Burnish) | Once, after the loop: tidies the code and keeps the README's generated facts section. |

JUDGE     ACCEPT (stands) · REJECT (whole tree put back) · INSUFFICIENT (held for a person)
```

Each seat imports Warden's data shapes and declares `requires_contract = "1"`; Warden
imports none of them. Warden tells the Drafter and the Finisher the grant's scope
(`documentation` or `code`) before it asks them.

**One command runs all seven.** With a clone of each repository in one folder (names matched
without regard to case):

```bash
warden tagteam PATH --stack FOLDER --authorize "Your Name" --reason "why" --scope code
```

Exit 0 means `ACCEPT` and nothing else does. Recorded run: 2026-10-14, every seat live on a
scratch repository, `ACCEPT` under both grants; see Warden's `docs/REGISTRY.json`.

Live path: Admission → OBSERVE/Keys → Locks → PERCEIVE → Decision → Conservation → Execution → Custody
Assurance: ASSAY · ghost_tools · SWIZZLE · Warden · Drafter · Judge · Burnish  (this circuit, off the live path)

CNS (private) holds the interoperability contracts. No repository in the circuit modifies it.
